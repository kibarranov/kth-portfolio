  <!-- WHY WORK WITH ME -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why work with me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m building a remote virtual assistant practice focused on data entry, inbox organization,
      transcription, and simple documentation. I draw on my experience in customer service, retail
      supervision, and transcription projects to support busy professionals and small teams in both
      English and Spanish. I’m comfortable working independently, following detailed instructions,
      and communicating asynchronously.
